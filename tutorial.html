    <h1><span style="color: #000000; font-size: x-large;">WHAT IS THE CLIMATE ANALOGUES TOOL?</span></h1>
</div>
<span style="font-size: medium;">The Climate Analogues approach allows researchers to identify, connect and map sites with statistically similar climates across space and time. The approach has the potential to be applied in agricultural policy and planning and provides a novel way to support climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector. CCAFS have provided an <span style="color: #008080;"><a href="http://analogues.ciat.cgiar.org/climate/"><span style="color: #008080;">online platform</span></a></span> (the Climate Analogues Tool) for quick, easily accessible and user-friendly applications of the Climate Analogues approach.</span>

<span style="font-size: medium;">Briefly, the Climate Analogues Tool allows you to analyze data (identify analogue sites) in <i>three temporal directions</i>, which correspond to three different questions (Fig. 1):</span>
<div style="float: right; width: 95%;">
    <ol>
        <li><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Where can I find sites at present that are climatically similar to how my site is projected to be in the future? </em>(Future→Present, “backward” direction).</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Where can I find sites in the future that will be climatically similar to how my site is at present?</em> (Present→Future, “forward” direction).</span></li>
        <li><span style="font-size: medium;"><em>Where can I find sites at present that are similar to my site?</em> Or, <em>where can I find sites in the projected future that will be similar to my site in the projected future?</em> (Present→Present/Future→Future,  no temporal direction, i.e "none").</span></li>
    </ol>

        </div>
        <span style="font-size: medium;"> </span>

        <span style="font-size: medium;">In order to run an analysis, you must first indicate the geographic location of the reference site. This can be done either by manually entering the latitude and longitude coordinates into the appropriate boxes or alternatively you may click on a location on the map to generate the coordinates. This process may be made quicker by using the drop down tab to zoom to the country within which the reference site will be located. The red target displayed on the map marks the reference site that will be used for the analysis (Fig. 2).</span>

        &nbsp;

        <span style="font-size: medium;">You must then designate the search area within which you want to find analogue sites:</span>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">- If you select the “global” search range, the tool will look for climate analogues across all land areas in the world excluding Antarctica (i.e. -60 to 90 degrees latitude, -180 to 180 degrees longitude). If you are unsure where you expect to find analogue sites the global search range may be a good starting point from which you can narrow your search later.</span></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">- Alternatively, you may also select a specific country or continent in order to focus the climate analogues search, speed processing time and produce results with a higher resolution. <i>Note</i>: the reference site does not have to located within the search range, i.e. you have the ability to look for an analogue of Nairobi, Kenya in the country of Brazil or the entire continent of South America.</span></p>

        &nbsp;

        &nbsp;

        &nbsp;

        <span style="font-size: medium;">In the second section “Select a direction and global climate models” you must define the temporal parameters for the analysis.</span>

        <span style="font-size: medium;">First, you define the <i>direction</i> in time in which run the analysis. The direction is very important because depending on which direction you choose the tool will produce different results with quite different interpretations.</span>

        <span style="font-size: medium;">Three options are available (Figure 3):</span>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">1. A <b>backward analysis</b>, in which the future climate of the reference site is compared with the present climate of all other locations in the search range,</span></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">2. A <b>forward analysis</b>, in which the present climate of the reference site is compared with the future climate of all other locations in the search range, or</span></p>
        <p style="padding-left: 60px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">3. A <b>non-directional analysis (none)</b>, in which the present/future climate of the reference site is compared with the present/future climate of all other locations in the search range.</span></p>
        &nbsp;
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ccafs-analogues.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/step-2.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-446" style="border: 1px solid black; max-width: 80%;" title="Step 2" alt="step 2" src="http://www.ccafs-analogues.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/step-2-1024x511.jpg" width="1024" height="511" /></a></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 3 </b>Selection of the direction of analysis and future climate scenarios</p>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-indent: 20px;">

            <span style="font-size: medium;">The baseline climate is calculated over the period 1960-1990 which is a commonly used reference period for future climate studies. Currently future climate forecasts are limited to the 2020-2049 time period (i.e the climate of the 2030s decade), however more options that forecast further into the future are to be added to the online tool. If you are performing a backwards or forwards analysis there are three emission scenarios to choose from: A1B, A2 and B1.  Each emission scenario describes future projected greenhouse gas emissions when global development proceeds with varying emphasis in areas of social and economic development, i.e. between globalisation vs regionalisation, and between an economic vs environmental focus. For example, emissions scenario A1B is an intermediate scenario which describes a future world of very rapid economic growth, low population growth and rapid introduction of new and more efficient technologies. As the future projected greenhouse gas emissions under each scenario vary they thus produce different projected future climatic conditions. For more information see the <span style="color: #008080;"><a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/special-reports/spm/sres-en.pdf"><span style="color: #008080;">IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios</span></a></span>.
            </span>

            <span style="font-size: medium;">You then need to select the global climate models (GCMs) that will be used in the analysis. It is possible to choose between the individual GCMs for each emission scenario or an ensemble which uses the average of all available GCMs. Results will vary slightly with each GCM. Generally, to decrease the uncertainties of GCMs, the ensemble option is preferred. However, in order to observe GCMs uncertainties, you can run each GCM separately and compare the results.</span>

            <span style="font-size: medium;">When applicable you may also select the <i>resolution</i> of the sites. Resolution refers to the pixel size of the input and, subsequently, output rasters. By selecting pixels of a smaller size (e.g. 30 arc seconds versus 10 arc minutes) the resolution of the results map will be increased but this comes at the cost of an increase in processing time. Thirty arc-seconds is approximately 1 km when measured at the equator while 10 arc-minutes is approximately 19 km.</span>

            <span style="font-size: medium;"> <strong>Temporal scale</strong>- The months of the year (growing season) that you want to focus the search on.</span>
            <span style="font-size: medium;"> <strong>Threshold</strong>- The minimum level of similarity that will be displayed on the results page.</span>

        <span style="font-size: medium;"> </span>

        &nbsp;

        &nbsp;

        <span style="font-size: medium;">You are able to select between two types of variables: climatic, which refer to monthly precipitation and mean temperature, or bioclimatic, which include 19 variables that describe in detail the seasonality, extremes, and climate averages of sites. A maximum combination of three variables may be selected simultaneously for each analysis (Fig. 4).</span>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ccafs-analogues.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/step-3.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-448" style="border: 1px solid black; max-width: 80%;" title="Step 3" alt="step 3" src="http://www.ccafs-analogues.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/step-3-1024x512.jpg" width="1024" height="512" /></a></p>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><b>Figure 4 </b>Types of climate variables, rotation, growing seasons and thresholds</p>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-indent: 20px;">

            <span style="font-size: medium;">There is also the option to <em>weight</em> the variables according to the importance we want to give them in the analysis. </span><span style="font-size: medium;">If you do not have insight into the importance of each variable in the search area</span><span style="font-size: medium;">, we suggest you first use equal weights of “0.5” for both temperature and precipitation in order to first observe these preliminary results. If one variable is known to be more influential you may modify the weights for temperature and precipitation.</span>

            <span style="font-size: medium;">The <i>rotation</i> allows you to compensate for the fact that rainfall events and temperature seasonality do not occur at the same period of the year in the northern and the southern hemispheres (as well as other less distinct, but equally important, regional variations). By selecting a rotation the tool will shift (rotate) the climatic data variables for all locations in the search range to align the underlying trends in the data and eliminate the effects of seasonality. Users are free to experiment with the rotations, however we recommend rotating by precipitation in tropical and subtropical locations where there is little seasonal temperature variation but the timing of the raining season may have large agronomic implications, and by temperature at higher latitudes where large seasonal variations in temperature may be observed, i.e. summer versus winter temperatures.</span>

            <span style="font-size: medium;">Then, a <i>temporal scope</i> can be specified to focus the calculation on a specific period during the year. If there is interest in a specific crop, we recommend defining this period in terms of the crop’s growing season. Up to two time periods may be specified and only the months falling within these time periods will be considered when calculating the climatic similarity of the sites. E.g. in Figure 4, the specific temporal scope is chosen from February to June. If you are interested in analyzing the entire year, and do not want to specify a growing season, leave the temporal scope set at 1 to 12 i.e. January to December.</span>

            <span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, a <i>threshold</i> value can be defined to restrict or filter the results of the analysis to only the most similar sites. i.e. selecting a threshold of 0.5 will result in only those sites with a similarity measure greater than 0.5 being displayed on the map.</span>

            <span style="font-size: medium;">Once all parameters are set, click on the <i>Run Analysis</i> button to begin the calculation. The calculation starts by loading the reference site data during ‘training’, continues by loading the weights, and then calculates the dissimilarity values between the reference site and all other sites within the search range. Depending on the climatic variables chosen, number of GCMs, the resolution chosen and size of the search range chosen results may take between 1 and 15+ minutes.</span>

    <h1><span style="font-size: x-large;">STEP 4: SELECTING CANDIDATE ANALOGUE SITES</span></h1>
    <div id="section4">
        <div style="text-indent: 20px;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The results are displayed on a basemap in discrete colours from low to high climate similarity with the reference site represented by the target symbol. If a threshold value was chosen only those sites whose CCAFS similarity statistic exceeds that value will be shown. You may zoom to investigate a specific area of interest, view results on a larger map and also print a summary report of your results. Figure 5 shows results of a backwards analysis of Nairobi, Kenya that identifies potential analogue sites to the west and north-east of the city. As the direction of this analysis was backwards the high similarity sites in this instance refer to areas that currently possess a climate that is similar to the future project climate of Nairobi.</span></div>
        <div style="text-indent: 20px;"></div>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ccafs-analogues.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/step-41.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-449" style="border: 1px solid black; max-width: 80%;" title="Step 4" alt="step 4" src="http://www.ccafs-analogues.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/step-41-1024x524.jpg" width="1024" height="524" /></a></p>

        &nbsp;

        &nbsp;

        <span style="font-size: medium;">The results page also provides a number of options to assist in visualizing the results and identifying candidate analogue sites:</span>
        <p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.ccafs-analogues.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/icons.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-294" style="border: solid black 1px; max-width: 80%;" title="Results icons" alt="icons" src="http://www.ccafs-analogues.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/icons-1024x681.jpg" width="1024" height="681" /></a></p>

        <div style="text-indent: 20px;">

            <span style="font-size: medium;">Upon finishing your first analysis, you can make addition runs by returning to the <i>Step 1. Select your location</i> window or alternatively <i>Step 2 </i>or <i>Step 3</i>. To save time the parameters used during the previous run remain loaded, so only the variables you wish to change need to be modified. The results of all subsequent runs will appear concurrently with the first on the results page, <i>Step 4. Selecting candidate analogue sites</i>.</span>

            <span style="font-size: medium;">We recommend that you do not rely on one single analogue run when identifying analogue sites as individual GCMs and emissions scenarios will produce slightly different projected future climates that may influence your results. While the use of the ensemble partly solves this problem by using the mean value from all available GCMs, it does not convey the variability of individual models. For more detailed analysis we recommend use of the <span style="color: #008080;"><a href="http://code.google.com/p/ccafs-analogues/"><span style="color: #008080;">Analogues R package</span></a></span>.</span>
